    "Selected Project Track: AI for Finance / Algorithmic Trading.\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem Statement: The cryptocurrency market operates 24/7 with extreme volatility, often leading human traders to make irrational decisions based on fear or greed (FOMO). This project addresses the need for a disciplined, automated system that removes emotional bias by executing trades based on objective technical indicators.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-world Relevance & Motivation: High-frequency trading requires sub-second execution speeds and constant monitoring that are impossible for humans. By automating the \"Mean Reversion\" strategy, we can capitalize on short-term price exhaustion (oversold/overbought) to generate consistent, small profits while strictly managing risk through automated stop-losses."

    "\n",
    "Future Scope:\n",

    "Sentiment Analysis Integration: A key future extension is the integration of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze social media and news sentiment, allowing the bot to pause trading during high-impact negative news events.\n",

    "Machine Learning Optimization: Future versions could replace the static RSI rules with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict price movements based on historical patterns rather than just current oscillators.\n",

    "Multi-Asset Support: Extending the pipeline to monitor and trade multiple pairs simultaneously (e.g., ETH, SOL) would diversify the risk and increase the frequency of high-probability opportunities.\n",
